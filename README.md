Hi! My name is YevgeniyðŸ‘‹ 
âœ¨It's nice to see you here!âœ¨
I would be happy to tell you about me. At the moment I write it(12/25/2023), I am a first-year student at [Nazarbayev University](https://nu.edu.kz) majoring in Robotics Engineering.
I recently started to be iterested in Machine Learning. I created this profile to share with you my learning path. It's because I think that showing your learning process publically really helps.
Even though I do not have much knowledge in this field, I do have some in C, Python and Databases(specifically SQLite). I will try my best to achieve my goal of becoming proficient in Machine Learning.
I will appriciate any help, comments, suggestions! 
So if you have some - please contact me through this info:
